# List

List are sortable, we can add an item to alist with '.append' and list items are always indexed with numbers starting at 0.

# Sets

Sets are not ordere, so the order in which items appear can be inconsistent and you add items to sets with '.add'. Like dictionaries and lists, sets are mutable.
We cannot have the same item twice in the sets and sets cannot be sorted.

# Dictionary

Each item in a dictionary contains two parts: a key and a value, the items in dictionary are not ordered. Because dictionaries are not ordered they are not sortable, and you do not add items to a dictionary with .append
