# The function in this quiz, median, returns the median value of an input list. 
# Unfortunately it only works with lists that have an odd number of elements. 
# Modify the function so that when median is given a list with an even number of elements, it returns the mean of the two central elements. 
# The provided test cases demonstrate the expected behavior.

    numbers.sort() #The sort method sorts a list directly, rather than returning a new sorted list
    middle_index = int(len(numbers)/2)
    return numbers[middle_index]

print("expected result: 2, actual result: {}".format(test1))

test2 = median([1,2,3,4])
print("expected result: 2.5, actual result: {}".format(test2))

test3 = median([53, 12, 65, 7, 420, 317, 88])
print("expected result: 65, actual result: {}".format(test3))
