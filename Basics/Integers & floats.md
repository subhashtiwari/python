When a number is a whole number it is called as an integer in Python.
But the number that are less than one but greater than zero are called as float or floating-point nummber.
This happens in case division mostly.
Also even if one integer divides another exactly, the result will be a float.

An operation involving an int and a float produces a float.

To make an int just give a whole number without a decimal point. To get an int write int(operation).
To make a float, include a decimal pont. To get the output in float write float(operation).
