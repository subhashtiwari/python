# Write a function called create_cast_list that takes a filename as input and returns a list of actors' names. It will be run on the file flying_circus_cast.txt (this information was collected from imdb.com).
# Each line of that file consists of an actor's name, a comma, and then some (messy) information about roles they played in the programme. You'll need to extract only the name and add it to a list. 
# You might use the .split() method to process each line.

def create_cast_list(filename):
    cast_list = []
    # use with to open the file filename
    with open(filename) as f:
    # use the for loop syntax to process each line        
    # and add the actor name to cast_list
        for line in f:
            line_data = line.split(',')
            cast_list.append(line_data[0])
    return cast_list
