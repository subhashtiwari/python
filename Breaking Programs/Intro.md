While coding we often make the code long enough by adding a new idea. This makes the code quite complicated and basically impossible to debug. 
The code might be full of celver ideas and slick implimentation, but it's impossible to read and simply can't be reused somewhere else. 

So it's important to plan the ideas before start coding, that one great idea that needs to be implemented, almost certainly got sevelral parts, multiple steps, or different cases that can be split apart, worked on and put back together again. 
Thhinking about the pieces of the problem we're solving before we write the code means we can lay plans, split up the work, and plan how to test the code.
