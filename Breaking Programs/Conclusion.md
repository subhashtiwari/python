Steps to build a function piece by piece

1. Gather the requirements for the function, including inputs and output.

2. Break that process down into steps in plain language first, not code.

3. Create an outline of a function that performed each of these steps, including helper functions that performed each of these steps, including helper functions that had not been defined.
At this stage, adjust the steps to make them easier to code up.

4. Create outlines of the helper functions.

5. Fill in the code of the helper functions, testing their functionality.

6. Complete the code of the main function to call each of the helper functions, and test the functionallity.
